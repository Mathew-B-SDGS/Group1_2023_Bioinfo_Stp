Features
==================
- Find the relevant gene panel for a genomic test to analyse sequence data from a patient appropriately

- Generate a BED file from a gene panel for genomic test analysis to use as an input to an NGS pipeline tool.

- Maintains a repository of which tests, gene panels, BED files, reference sequences and versions which have been applied to each patient case so that the laboratory has an accurate record of how analyses were performed

- Currently using Genomic Test Directory (Version 5.1, updated 1st June 2023). This will need to be updated upon release of the new version
